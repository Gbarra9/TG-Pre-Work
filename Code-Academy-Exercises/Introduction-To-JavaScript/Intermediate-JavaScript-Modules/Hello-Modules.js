// JavaScript modules are reusable pieces of code that can be exported from one program and imported for use in another program

/*
Modules uses:
-find, fix and easily debug code
-reuse and recycle defined logic in different parts of application
-keep information private and protected from other modules
-prevent pollution of global namespace and potential naming collisions, by cautiously selecting variables and behavior we load into a program
