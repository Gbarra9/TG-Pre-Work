// When multiple classes share propeties or methods they are candidates for inheritance
// inheritance is a tool developers use to type less code


// Inheritance allows developers to create parent classes(superclasses) with properties and methods that multiple child classes (subclasses) share
// The child classes inherit properties and methods from parent classes
