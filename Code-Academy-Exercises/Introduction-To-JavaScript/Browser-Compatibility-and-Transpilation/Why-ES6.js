/*
Reasons for ES5 to ES6 updates:
- To be syntacticlly similar to other object-oriented programming languages

- Readability and economy of code --> ES6 is easier to understand and requires fewer characters to create same functionality

- Addresses bugs in ES5 originating from Es5 syntax

ECMA made ES6 backwards compatible
