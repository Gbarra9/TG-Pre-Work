## When we hit https://www.techtonicgroup.com/ what happens? Don’t focus too much on architecture (Monolithic, SOA, Microservices, etc.). Try to focus more on how the web functions.

As a user we place the URL address into the web browser. The web browser is a program installed on the computer that retrieves information from the server. The server checks the for correct files. The client waits and goes on standby. The server that stores all the code for Techtonicgroup will find files and sends them to the web browser. The web browser reads, translates the code and will finally render the text, images and videos to the client device.

## From start to finish how does that data reach you to be rendered in the browser?

The internet is by definition a giant network of computers creating a network infrastructure. Computers connected to the internet have a unique internet protocol in the form of four different numbers, these numbers identify the computer on the internet. Computers on the internet communicate with each other using protocol a language where computers can understand each other. When a person uses their browser with a URL, the URL is associated with a unique ip address composed of four numbers. The IP address tells computer which computer connected to the internet has the correct data being queried. The browser finds the computer with the specified information and waits for response from computer with information. After waiting for response, a successful request from another computer will send data to the client's computer. Data is sent through wiring infrastructure that connects the computers on the internet. Data sent via the internet are sent as broken pieces called packets. These packets are sent one at a time and reassembled. Once the computer with browser retrieves information from other computer, the contents will be read and displayed by the browser on a webpage.
